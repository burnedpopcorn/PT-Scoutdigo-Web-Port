## Downloads
Source Code and Compiled Web Build can be Downloaded From the Releases Tab

### Current Issues
There are Issues, such as:
- 
That's Good!

## For Compiling
- Use GameMaker Studio Version 2023.4.0.84 to compile for Web
- Compile using GX.GAMES + VM options
> [!WARNING]
> YYC has NOT been Tested

- After the game has ALREADY compiled and loaded on your browser, steal the temp files from

```C:\Users\ (YOUR USER) \AppData\Local\GameMakerStudio2\GMS2TEMP```

    - In where you will find folders called `indigo_( SOME NUMBERS )_VM`
    - Steal the `/runner` sub-directory from the most recent one, as that folder contains the important files
- After that, you have the compilied files ready for use in a server

## Thanks to
- Tour de Pizza for the base game
- The Scoutdigo Team for making this Mod in the first place
> Ima be honest, I have no idea who worked on this mod
- DaLeKer, for leaking the Source Code on Youtube
> The Source Code in Releases is modified to make it this port work
